And now it\'s up to Sulley and Mike to send Boo back in her door before anybody finds out, especially two evil villains such as Sulley\'s main rival as a scarer, chameleon-like Randall (a monster that Boo is very afraid of), who possesses the ability to change the color of his skin, and Mike and Sulley\'s boss Mr. Waternoose, the chairman and chief executive officer of Monsters, Inc.', 'https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/3/38/Mike1.png/revision/latest?cb=20181009061353', 'Mike Wazowski', NULL, 2, 2, '2018-10-20 00:00:00'),

However, Waternoose still says the slogan. Also, many other picture inscriptions (like the title of Waternoose as chairman of Monsters, Inc.) are omitted from the TV advertising and from other ad posters seen later during the film.\r\n\r\nFor the Blu-Ray release, the Snowman\'s snow cones have been digitally altered to look plain yellow, as opposed to the original version, which looks rather like snow that had been urinated on.\r\n\r\nThe 3D version, as well as the 2013 DVD &amp; Blu-ray releases, replaces the Disney logo with the more current logo.\r\n\r\nOriginally in the scene where Harryhausen\'s is decontaminated, instead of quarantining the area, the restaurant is blown up. This was likely because of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\r\n\r\nOne shot of Sulley trying to tell Boo to go to sleep was replaced for the non-English versions of the film. This was because his hand gestures, miming the phrase &quot;You go to sleep&quot;, are so closely related to the individual words (for example, holding up two fingers for the word &quot;to&quot;) that dubbing the shot into other languages would have proved too difficult.\r\n\r\nForeign language versions of the film feature visual text (ie: newspaper headlines, street signs) written in languages in which the film is dubbed, in order to eliminate the need for subtitles. In addition, universal icons are put in place of English text, such as a pedestrian traffic light that features a multi-fingered hand (in place of &quot;Don\'t Stalk&quot;) and a two-headed beast (instead of &quot;Stalk&quot;).	It also appears that in order to minimize the &quot;poorly-dubbed kung-fu movie&quot; syndrome, all the lip synch is completely redone for foreign language releases.\r\n\r\nMuch as they did with _A Bug\'s Life_, Pixar recomposed various shots this movie for the full screen (1.33:1 aspect ratio) presentation on home video. Characters and objects were rearranged in order to better make use of the narrower frame.\r\n\r\nStarting 7 December 2001 outtakes were added to the end credit sequence of the theatrical release, showing bloopers such as Sulley tripping over the top scarers, and a new scene at the very end of the credits in which Mike makes good on his promise and produces the company play, &quot;Put That Thing Back Where It Came From or So Help Me&quot;, a musical version of the entire film.

The agents then shave George\'s fur off, have him showered, and place a cone on his head.\r\n\r\nLater on in the film, Sulley puts some of Boo\'s toys in George\'s locker which George accidentally left open, and when George opens it the next day, the toys fall on top of his head and Charlie calls again for the CDA agents who come and jump on George again, putting more cones on him.\r\n\r\nLater, when Charlie gets George a door from Nepal, Sulley bursts through after being banished and a sock falls on George\'s chest. Just as Charlie is about to call for the CDA again, George stuffs the sock into Charlie\'s mouth and throws Charlie into the kid\'s door and walks away happily while whistling.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the film, George\'s fur grows back and works on his own on the new Laugh Floor making kids laugh instead of trying to scare them.

(6, 1, 0, 'King\'s Post', 'King of the blues', 'His reign as King of the Blues has been as long as that of any monarch on earth. For more than half a century, Riley B. King \\u2013 better known as B.B. King \\u2013 has defined the blues for a worldwide audience. Since he started recording in the 1940s, he has released over fifty albums, many of them classics. He was born September 16, 1925, on a plantation in Itta Bena, Mississippi, near Indianola. In his youth, he played on street corners for dimes, and would sometimes play in as many as four towns a night. In 1947, he hitchhiked to Memphis, TN, to pursue his music career. Memphis was where every important musician of the South gravitated, and which supported a large musical community where every style of African American music could be found. B.B. stayed with his cousin Bukka White, one of the most celebrated blues performers of his time, who schooled B.B. further in the art of the blues.\\n\\nB.B.\\u2019s first big break came in 1948 when he performed on Sonny Boy Williamson\\u2019s radio program on KWEM out of West Memphis. This led to steady engagements at the Sixteenth Avenue Grill in West Memphis, and later to a ten-minute spot on black-staffed and managed Memphis radio station WDIA. \\u201cKing\\u2019s Spot,\\u201d became so popular, it was expanded and became the \\u201cSepia Swing Club.\\u201d Soon B.B. needed a catchy radio name. What started out as Beale Street Blues Boy was shortened to Blues Boy King, and eventually B.B. King.\\n\\nIn the mid-1950s, while B.B. was performing at a dance in Twist, Arkansas, a few fans became unruly. Two men got into a fight and knocked over a kerosene stove, setting fire to the hall. B.B. raced outdoors to safety with everyone else, then realized that he left his beloved $30 acoustic guitar inside, so he rushed back inside the burning building to retrieve it, narrowly escaping death. When he later found out that the fight had been over a woman named Lucille, he decided to give the name to his guitar to remind him never to do a crazy thing like fight over a woman. Ever since, each one of B.B.\\u2019s trademark Gibson guitars has been called Lucille.\\n\\nSoon after his number one hit, \\u201cThree O\\u2019Clock Blues,\\u201d B.B. began touring nationally. In 1956, B.B. and his band played an astonishing 342 one-night stands. From the chitlin circuit with its small-town cafes, juke joints, and country dance halls to rock palaces, symphony concert halls, universities, resort hotels and amphitheaters, nationally and internationally, B.B. has become the most renowned blues musician of the past 40 years.\\n\\nOver the years, B.B. has developed one of the world\\u2019s most identifiable guitar styles. He borrowed from Blind Lemon Jefferson, T-Bone Walker and others, integrating his precise and complex vocal-like string bends and his left hand vibrato, both of which have become indispensable components of rock guitarist\\u2019s vocabulary. His economy, his every-note-counts phrasing, has been a model for thousands of players, from Eric Clapton and George Harrison to Jeff Beck. B.B. has mixed traditional blues, jazz, swing, mainstream pop and jump into a unique sound. In B.B.\\u2019s words, \\u201cWhen I sing, I play in my mind; the minute I stop singing orally, I start to sing by playing Lucille.\\u201d\\n\\nIn 1968, B.B. played at the Newport Folk Festival and at Bill Graham\\u2019s Fillmore West on bills with the hottest contemporary rock artists of the day who idolized B.B. and helped to introduce him to a young white audience. In \\u201c69, B.B. was chosen by the Rolling Stones to open 18 American concerts for them; Ike and Tina Turner also played on 18 shows.\\n\\nB.B. was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 1984 and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. He received NARAS\\u2019 Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award in 1987, and has received honorary doctorates from Tougaloo(MS) College in 1973; Yale University in 1977; Berklee College of Music in 1982; Rhodes College of Memphis in 1990; Mississippi Valley State University in 2002 and Brown University in 2007. In 1992, he received the National Award of Distinction from the University of Mississippi.\\n\\nIn 1991, B.B. King\\u2019s Blues Club opened on Beale Street in Memphis, and in 1994, a second club was launched at Universal CityWalk in Los Angeles. A third club in New York City\\u2019s Times Square opened in June 2000 and most recently two clubs opened at Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut in January 2002. In 1996, the CD-Rom On The Road With B.B. King: An Interactive Autobiography was released to rave reviews. Also in 1996, B.B.\\u2019s autobiography, \\u201cBlues All Around Me\\u201d (written with David Ritz for Avon Books) was published. In a similar vein, Doubleday published \\u201cThe Arrival of B.B. King\\u201d by Charles Sawyer, in 1980.\\n\\nB.B. continued to tour extensively, averaging over 250 concerts per year around the world. Classics such as \\u201cPayin\\u2019 The Cost To Be The Boss,\\u201d \\u201cThe Thrill Is Gone,\\u201d How Blue Can You Get,\\u201d \\u201cEveryday I Have The Blues,\\u201d and \\u201cWhy I Sing The Blues\\u201d are concert (and fan) staples. Over the years, the Grammy Award-winner has had two #1 R&amp;B hits, 1951\\u2019s \\u201cThree O\\u2019Clock Blues,\\u201d and 1952\\u2019s \\u201cYou Don\\u2019t Know Me,\\u201d and four #2 R&amp;B hits, 1953\\u2019s \\u201cPlease Love Me,\\u201d 1954\\u2019s \\u201cYou Upset Me Baby,\\u201d 1960\\u2019s \\u201cSweet Sixteen, Part I,\\u201d and 1966\\u2019s \\u201cDon\\u2019t Answer The Door, Part I.\\u201d B.B.\\u2019s most popular crossover hit, 1970\\u2019s \\u201cThe Thrill Is Gone,\\u201d went to #15 pop.\\n\\nOn May 14th 2015 the world lost a true gentleman.

(7, 1, 1, 'David\'s Post', 'British heavy metal', 'In 1973, Coverdale saw an article in a copy of Melody Maker, which said that Deep Purple was auditioning for singers to replace Ian Gillan. Coverdale had fronted a local group called The Government, which had played with Deep Purple on the same bill in 1969, so he and the band were familiar with one another, and after sending a tape and later auditioning, Coverdale was admitted into the band, with bassist Glenn Hughes adding his own vocals as well.\r\n\r\nIn February 1974, Deep Purple released their first album with Coverdale and Hughes titled Burn which was certified Gold in the US on 20 March 1974 and in the UK on 1 July. In April 1974, Coverdale and Deep Purple performed to over 200,000 fans on his first trip to the United States at California Jam.\r\n\r\nIn December 1974 Burn was followed-up by Stormbringer, which also ranked at Gold album status in the US and the UK. The funk and soul influences of the previous record were even more prominent here, and this was one of the reasons why guitarist Ritchie Blackmore left the band in June 1975.\r\n\r\nRather than disbanding, Coverdale was instrumental in persuading the band to continue with American guitarist Tommy Bolin (of Billy Cobham and The James Gang fame). As Jon Lord put it, &quot;David Coverdale came up to me and said, \'Please keep the band together.\' David played me the album that Tommy did with Billy Cobham. We liked his playing on it and invited Tommy to audition.\'&quot; The band released one studio album with Bolin, Come Taste the Band in 1975. The album was less successful than previous records, and at the end of the tour in March 1976, Coverdale reportedly walked off in tears and handed in his resignation, to which he was told there was no band left to quit. The decision to disband Deep Purple had been made some time before the last show by Lord and Ian Paice (the last remaining original members), who had not told anyone else. The break-up was finally made public in July 1976. Said Coverdale in an interview: &quot;I was frightened to leave the band. Purple was my life, Purple gave me my break, but all the same I wanted out.&quot;\r\n\r\nAfter the demise of Deep Purple, Coverdale embarked on a solo career. He released his first album in February 1977, titled White Snake. All songs were written by Coverdale and guitarist Micky Moody. As his first solo effort, Coverdale later admitted: &quot;It\'s very difficult to think back and talk sensibly about the first album. White Snake had been a very inward-looking, reflective and low-key affair in many ways, written and recorded as it was in the aftermath of the collapse of Deep Purple.&quot; Even though the album was not successful, its title inspired the name of Coverdale\'s future band.\r\n\r\nIn 1978 Coverdale released his second solo album Northwinds, which was received much better than the previous album. But before the album\'s release, he had already formed a new band.\r\n\r\nAfter recording Northwinds, Coverdale soon formed the band Whitesnake, with Bernie Marsden and Micky Moody both handling guitar duties. This was originally a touring band for Coverdale\'s first solo album, it soon developed into a full-time band. In early 1978, the band released the Snakebite EP, which was later repackaged as a full album (titled Snakebite, released in June 1978), with the B-side taken from Coverdale\'s Northwinds album. For the follow-up album, Trouble, Coverdale was joined by his former Deep Purple colleague, keyboardist Jon Lord. For Whitesnake\'s 1980 album, Ready an\' Willing, drummer Ian Paice also joined the group. Ready an\' Willing also featured the band\'s biggest hit up to that point, the song &quot;Fool for Your Loving&quot;, which reached No. 13 on the British charts and No. 53 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Ready an\' Willing was followed up by the even more successful Come an\' Get It in 1981. During 1982 Coverdale took some time off to look after his sick daughter and decided to put Whitesnake on hold. When David Coverdale returned to music he reformed the band, which thereafter recorded the album Saints &amp; Sinners.\r\n\r\nIn 1982, according to British heavy metal magazine Kerrang!, Coverdale was considered for the vocalist position with Black Sabbath following the departure of Ronnie James Dio. Coverdale declined.', 'http://assets.blabbermouth.net/media/davidcoverdalejourneys2016_638.jpg', 'David Coverdale', NULL, 1, 3, '2018-11-12 00:00:00');
